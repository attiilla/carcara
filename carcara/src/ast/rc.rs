//! This module implements a variant of `Rc` where equality and hashing are done by reference.

use std::{fmt, hash::Hash, ops::Deref, sync};

/// A wrapper for `std::rc::Rc` where equality and hashing are done by reference, instead of by
/// value.
///
/// This means that two `Rc`s will not be considered equal and won't have the same hash value unless
/// they point to the same allocation. This has the advantage that equality and hashing can be done
/// in constant time, even for recursive structures.
///
/// The Carcara parser makes use of hash consing, meaning that each term is only allocated once,
/// even if it appears multiple times in the proof. This means that if we want to compare two terms
/// for equality, we only need to compare them by reference, since if they are equal they will point
/// to the same allocation. However, `std::rc::Rc` implements `PartialEq` by comparing the inner
/// values for equality. If we simply used this implementation, each equality comparison would need
/// to traverse the terms recursively, which would be prohibitively expensive. Instead, this wrapper
/// overrides the `PartialEq` implementation to compare the pointers directly, allowing for constant
/// time equality comparisons.
///
/// Similarly, when inserting terms in a hash map or set, we can also just hash the pointers
/// instead of recursively hashing the inner value (as `std::rc::Rc`'s `Hash` implementation does).
/// Therefore, this wrapper also overrides the implementation of the `Hash` trait.
///
/// Note: when using this struct, it's important to avoid constructing terms with `Rc::new` and
/// instead prefer to construct them by adding them to a `TermPool`. This is because `Rc::new` will
/// create a brand new allocation for that term, instead of reusing the existing allocation if that
/// term was already added to the pool. Two indentical terms created independently with `Rc::new`
/// will not compare as equal.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use carcara::ast::Rc;
/// let a = Rc::new(5);
/// let b = Rc::new(5);
/// assert_ne!(a, b);
///
/// let c = a.clone();
/// assert_eq!(a, c);
/// ```
///
/// While `a` and `b` have the same contents, they are not considered equal. However, since `c` was
/// created by cloning `a`, they point to the same allocation, and are thus considered equal. The
/// same thing happens with their hash values:
///
/// ```
/// # use carcara::ast::Rc;
/// # use std::collections::HashSet;
/// # let a = Rc::new(5);
/// # let b = Rc::new(5);
/// # let c = a.clone();
/// let mut set = HashSet::new();
/// set.insert(a);
/// assert!(!set.contains(&b));
/// assert!(set.contains(&c));
/// ```
